# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# This function takes last element as pivot, places
# the pivot element at its correct position in sorted
# array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot)
# to left of pivot and all greater elements to right
# of pivot
def partition(arr, low, high):
    i = (low - 1)  # index of smaller element
    pivot = arr[high]  # pivot

    for j in range(low, high):

        # If current element is smaller than or
        # equal to pivot
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            # increment index of smaller element
            i = i + 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1


# The main function that implements QuickSort
# arr[] --> Array to be sorted,
# low  --> Starting index,
# high  --> Ending index

# Function to do Quick sort
